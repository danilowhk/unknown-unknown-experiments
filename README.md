# 🧪 Daily Unknown-Unknown Experiments

## The Mission

Every day, discover one thing you didn't know was possible. **Literally anything.** No boundaries. Run real code. Get real evidence. Document honestly—including failures.

> "The goal is to explore the space of things I don't know that I don't know."

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

1. **Raw logs only** — no summaries, no paraphrasing
2. **First-try success with zero errors = suspicious** — reality is messy
3. **Prove it externally** — something in the real world changed
4. **Failures are data** — document them fully, they map boundaries

---

## The Only Rule

**Go extreme.** Pick whatever seems most "there's no way this works" and try it. Network, hardware, APIs, AI, blockchain, physical devices, system internals, reverse engineering, automation—anything.

The weirder the better. The more "I had no idea you could do that" the better.
