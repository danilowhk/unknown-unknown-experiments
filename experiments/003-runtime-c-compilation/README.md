# Experiment #003: Runtime C Compilation
**Date:** 2025-12-31  
**"Wait, that's possible?" Score:** 9/10

## Question
Can Python code generate its own C extension at runtime, compile it, and call it—all without any pre-existing compiled code?

## Why It Matters
If this works, it fundamentally blurs the line between interpreted and compiled languages. It means a Python script can become a miniature Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, dynamically generating high-performance C code tailored to the immediate task. This could unlock:
- **Self-Optimizing Software:** Programs that identify their own bottlenecks and rewrite them in C for massive speedups.
- **Runtime Specialization:** Generating C code that is hyper-optimized for the specific hardware it's running on or the specific data it's processing.
- **Dynamic Functionality:** Creating and loading new, low-level capabilities that didn't exist when the program started.

## The Code
The entire experiment is contained in a single Python script.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Experiment: Can Python generate, compile, and execute C code at runtime?

This script will:
1. Generate C source code as a string
2. Write it to a file
3. Compile it into a shared library using GCC
4. Load the compiled library dynamically
5. Call functions from it
6. All without any pre-existing compiled code!

## Raw Output
- [First Run](./evidence/run1_output.txt)
- [Second Run](./evidence/run2_output.txt)

## Validation
- [x] **External proof exists:** The script successfully created a shared library (`.so` file). We verified this with `ls` and the `file` command, which confirmed it is a 64-bit ELF shared object. We also inspected the library's symbol table with `nm`, which showed our C functions were present and executable. ([See evidence files](./evidence/))
- [x] **Reproducible:** Ran the script twice and got the same successful outcome both times. The performance gains were consistent.
- [x] **Output contains info I couldn't have guessed:** The exact memory addresses from `get_stack_address()`, the CPU cycle counts from `get_cpu_cycles()`, and the precise compilation/execution times are non-deterministic and prove the code ran live.
- [x] **A skeptic would believe this:** The chain of evidence is complete: the script exists, the raw logs show it invoking the compiler, the compiled file is created, and its binary contents are inspected and verified. The performance difference is too large to be faked.

## Confidence
🟢 **Confirmed**

## Learnings
- **What surprised me?** How simple it was. Python's standard libraries (`subprocess`, `ctypes`, `tempfile`) are all you need to create a full compilation pipeline. There's no need for complex build tools or third-party packages. The ability to call `__asm__` and run CPU-specific instructions like `rdtsc` from a dynamically generated library is mind-blowing.
- **What new questions emerged?**
    - Could this be wrapped into a simple Python decorator (e.g., `@jit_compile_c`) that automatically converts a Python function into a compiled C extension?
    - How robust is this? What are the error handling and security implications of dynamically compiling and loading code?
    - Could we generate C code that is specifically optimized for the CPU architecture (`-march=native`) it detects at runtime?
- **What's the next rabbit hole?** Building a proof-of-concept "JIT decorator." It would take a Python function's source, translate it to a C equivalent, and then use this runtime compilation technique to seamlessly replace the slow Python function with a fast, compiled C version.
