EXECUTABLE IMAGE EXPERIMENT
Can we run code extracted from a PNG image?
============================================================

Creating x86-64 shellcode...
✓ Shellcode created (49 bytes)

============================================================
STEP 1: ENCODING MACHINE CODE INTO IMAGE
============================================================

Code size: 49 bytes
Code (hex): 48c7c00100000048c7c701000000488d350a00000048c7c2120000000f05c348656c6c6f2066726f6d20696d616765210a

Image dimensions: 8x7 pixels

✓ Code encoded into image: /home/ubuntu/unknown-unknown-experiments/experiments/004-executable-image/evidence/executable_code.png
✓ Image saved successfully

============================================================
STEP 2: EXTRACTING MACHINE CODE FROM IMAGE
============================================================

Image dimensions: 8x7 pixels

Extracted 49 bytes
Code (hex): 48c7c00100000048c7c701000000488d350a00000048c7c2120000000f05c348656c6c6f2066726f6d20696d616765210a

✓ Extraction successful - byte count matches

✓ VERIFIED: Extracted code matches original perfectly

============================================================
STEP 3: EXECUTING CODE FROM IMAGE
============================================================

⚠️  WARNING: About to execute code extracted from an image!

✓ Allocated 49 bytes of executable memory
✓ Copied code into memory

Memory address: 0x7fd2b771a000

Executing code...
------------------------------------------------------------
Hello from image!

------------------------------------------------------------

✓ Code executed successfully!
✓ The message above was printed by code extracted from an image!
============================================================
STEP 4: CREATING VISUAL PROOF
============================================================

✓ Created zoomed image: /home/ubuntu/unknown-unknown-experiments/experiments/004-executable-image/evidence/executable_code_zoomed.png
  (Each pixel contains one byte of machine code)

============================================================
EXPERIMENT SUMMARY
============================================================

✓ VALIDATED: We successfully executed code from an image!

What this means:
  • Images can contain executable machine code
  • Pixel data can be interpreted as instructions
  • A PNG file literally RAN and printed text

Confidence: 🟢 CONFIRMED

This is possible because:
  1. Images are just bytes in memory
  2. CPUs don't care where code comes from
  3. With proper permissions, any bytes can execute

Real-world implications:
  • Novel steganography technique
  • Potential security vector (malicious images)
  • Code obfuscation method
  • Polyglot file format attacks

Evidence saved to:

  • executable_code.png - The image containing machine code
  • executable_code_zoomed.png - Zoomed view of pixels
